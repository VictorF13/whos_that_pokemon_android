# Who's That Pokémon?

This is a simple "Who's That Pokémon" Android app built using Flutter.

## What does it do?

The app has a single screen which, upon entering, loads a silhouette of a Pokémon. The user must then type in the name of the Pokémon, and, if it's the correct name, it'll reveal the Pokémon and load another one. If the user doesn't know the Pokémon, they can press the "I don't know." button, which will prompt a new Pokémon to be generated.

This is meant to be a learning project, so I may update it or release it in the future.
